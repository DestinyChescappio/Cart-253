Artist's statement

Introduction-
Project 2 is titled "Save Mr.Snowman". I initially only wanted to add fireballs and snowballs with Mr.Snowman only but I am happy with the outcome of the added concepts of how he melts while moving, jumping over moving kids, and the kids stealing his magic hat. I believe these additions has helped me not only further into challenging myself into coding, but it has also improved and the game's concept.

Game Concept-
My goal is have a mini game that contains a winter wonderland filled with falling snowballs, fireballs, kids running across, and Mr.Snowman. The user has full control of Mr.Snowman to keep him alive as he dodges the falling fireballs that eventually melt him away. Mr.Snowman is limited to running because he eventually melts away as well. He must also jump over the running kids because they will eventually knock off his magic hat and he will not be able to move and continue his quest to survive. The falling snowballs are to be collected to maintain Mr.Snowman's chances of survival before melting away completely. The ultimate goal is to collect 20 snowballs in order to win the game.

Inspirations-
My inspirations came from the movie Jack Frost when the character Charlie plays his dad's harmonica, which revives his dad's spirit into the snowman he made. In comparison, I was inspired by the magic object, which in the game's case, is a hat. Since the holidays are coming up, I thought I would end my first semester with a nice winter themed game. The snowball collecting sound is set at random rates because random notes of a triangle instrument is what I imagine how snowflakes would sound falling on the ground (all sounds used are from freesound.org).

Artistic Vision-
In the creative process, I believe I accomplished the project's objectives and I achieved my artistic vision when first starting the project. I envisioned an interactive winter wonderland game that users can enjoy during the holidays. I included interactivity of having the user play the protagonist in a survival game. The game challenges the user to think ahead before rushing to collect all snowballs before melting while running, jumping too soon and hitting a fireball, or bumping into the kids. I also wanted to incorporate my other skills in digital art with making my own gif animations and graphic design for both the game background and state pages.

Technical-
Regarding the technical exploration, I worked mainly with object oriented-programming, inheritance, arrays, and sounds. I created each object their own class that communicate as their own arrays in the main script. Each have their own function that store their methods from their classes and other new updated behaviour. Each object (kids, fireballs, snowballs) interact and manipulate Mr.Snowman's behaviour of size and his hat, which leads to the game's state of winning, losing, or losing magic (which are located in the main script). The sounds are also stored in the main script because Mr.Snowman triggers the sounds when he interacts with the snowballs or fireballs. My main challenge in the creative process was getting Mr.Snowman's whole body (his head and bottom body) to be in sync with one another since they were both separate and needed to be one - his body and head would separate and shift when not on command. It was mind boggling, yet an experience and lesson to learn about working with original objects even though it would have been easier to have a snowman image or gif that had the same behaviour, but less coding. I think that specific challenge demonstrated the importance and determination of my creativity.
