/**
Dodging Covid-19
Destiny Chescappio

COVID-19, represented by a red circle, will move from the left side of the canvas to the right at a random y position. Each time it reaches the right side, it will reset to the left at a random y position. The user will control their own circle with the mouse position. If the COVID-19 circle touches the user circle, everything stops! In the background we see random static for visual flair and we donâ€™t see the mouse cursor.
